A little over a week ago I started with this post and got a crazy amount of feedback, much more than I had thought I would get. To be dead honest I wasn't sure if I was going to finish it, but the positive feedback I got drove me to buckle down and really hammer this thing out both well and in a timely fashion.\n\n\t\t\tTo make this I pulled from about 5 different version of the canvas, including a version by u/DavidXGA made by taking the median value of all the pixels on the canvas in the final hour, which was a great reference as it helped remove a lot of the noise from the canvas. I also referenced an unfinished version of the canvas edit being made by r/thefinalclean when all other sources failed me, so a big thank you and props to them for their undertaking.\n\n\t\t\tMy philosophy when making this was to try and retain as much originality as possible, as opposed to the thefinalclean team whose goal was more centered on creating the cleanest version of the canvas possible. Any fun little quirks, I wanted to stay in the canvas. That means all the little hidden among us characters, tiny non-invasive pixel arts, and so on. In areas where there was a particularly large amount of chaos going on, my goal was to simply retain the chaos there and clean up as best I can around it, as it wouldn't feel right to make any significant changes to a community project to me.\n\n\t\t\tI recognize that this project is imperfect, and by the very nature of making something like this, certain arts will have to have been excluded. Unfortunately, that's just how things are, and for anyone whose art didn't make the cut, I'm sorry. I may or may not come back to this post to fix some minor flaws the the future, but don't expect changes if it's only a couple pixels off. If I did make any major mistakes though, sound off in the comments and I'll take note of it.\n\n\t\t\tThank you so much everyone for your support in making this! r/place was genuinely the most fun I had on reddit in years and I'm happy to give back to the community. If you like what I've done, all I ask for is an upvote and for you to enjoy whatever use you may find for my cleanup.
