# The 2022 r/place Atlas

This is a project to collect all canvas variations of Reddit's r/place April Fools event in 2022. These canvases are collected from various sources, primarily Reddit sources.

This project is the derivation of [The r/place 2022 Atlas](https://place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/), which I contribute in part of. The codebase have been heavily modified and simplified for the use of this project. Source code are available with [the AGPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/Hans5958/place-catalog/blob/master/LICENSE).

Credit to the [contributors of the Atlas](https://github.com/placeAtlas/atlas/contributors) for the original project, and for each of the authors of the variations (specific credits are available on the information tab).

## Contributing

This project is open source. You may contribute to the project by submitting a pull request. You can also create a issue in [the issues tab](https://github.com/Hans5958/place-catalog/issues).

If your canvas variation is missing on this project, you may create an issue which I will respond if available.

Contributions of the codebase are also available on The r/place 2022 Atlas the repository, as well as atlas entries. [Read more](https://github.com/placeAtlas/atlas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
